              <h3>Introduction</h3><hr>
              <p>
                A computer virus is a type of malicious software program that replicates itself and spreads from one computer to another, often without the knowledge or consent of the user. It is designed to cause damage, steal information, disrupt computer systems, or perform other harmful actions. Computer viruses can infect various types of files, including executable programs, documents, and even the master boot record of a computer.

The term "virus" is derived from its biological counterpart, as computer viruses exhibit similar behavior by infecting a host and reproducing themselves. However, unlike biological viruses, computer viruses require human intervention or specific conditions to propagate. They are typically spread through infected files, email attachments, infected websites, or removable storage devices.

Once a computer virus infects a system, it can execute various actions, depending on its design and intent. Some common effects of computer viruses include:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Replication: Viruses often aim to create multiple copies of themselves to spread to other computers or devices. They may attach their code to legitimate files or create new files with malicious code, making it challenging to detect and remove them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Destruction or Corruption: Some viruses are programmed to delete files, format hard drives, or corrupt data, resulting in loss of information and system instability. These actions can be particularly damaging to critical files or important data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unauthorized Access: Certain viruses allow unauthorized individuals to gain remote access to infected computers. This can enable hackers to control the system, monitor user activity, and steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or personal data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Botnet Creation: Viruses can transform infected computers into "zombies" or "bots," forming a network of compromised machines known as a botnet. These botnets can be remotely controlled by cybercriminals to carry out coordinated attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or spam email campaigns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spyware and Keylogging: Some viruses are designed to track user activity, collect sensitive information, or capture keystrokes (keylogging). This information can then be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to online accounts.
                </li>
              </ol>
              </p>
              <h3>History</h3><hr>
              <p> The history of computer viruses dates back to the early days of computing, when programmers discovered the potential for self-replicating and malicious code. Here is a brief overview of the key milestones in the history of computer viruses:
                <ol>

              <h3>Introduction</h3><hr>
              <p>
                A computer virus is a type of malicious software program that replicates itself and spreads from one computer to another, often without the knowledge or consent of the user. It is designed to cause damage, steal information, disrupt computer systems, or perform other harmful actions. Computer viruses can infect various types of files, including executable programs, documents, and even the master boot record of a computer.

The term "virus" is derived from its biological counterpart, as computer viruses exhibit similar behavior by infecting a host and reproducing themselves. However, unlike biological viruses, computer viruses require human intervention or specific conditions to propagate. They are typically spread through infected files, email attachments, infected websites, or removable storage devices.

Once a computer virus infects a system, it can execute various actions, depending on its design and intent. Some common effects of computer viruses include:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Replication: Viruses often aim to create multiple copies of themselves to spread to other computers or devices. They may attach their code to legitimate files or create new files with malicious code, making it challenging to detect and remove them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Destruction or Corruption: Some viruses are programmed to delete files, format hard drives, or corrupt data, resulting in loss of information and system instability. These actions can be particularly damaging to critical files or important data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unauthorized Access: Certain viruses allow unauthorized individuals to gain remote access to infected computers. This can enable hackers to control the system, monitor user activity, and steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or personal data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Botnet Creation: Viruses can transform infected computers into "zombies" or "bots," forming a network of compromised machines known as a botnet. These botnets can be remotely controlled by cybercriminals to carry out coordinated attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or spam email campaigns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spyware and Keylogging: Some viruses are designed to track user activity, collect sensitive information, or capture keystrokes (keylogging). This information can then be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to online accounts.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h3>Introduction</h3><hr>
              <p>
                A computer virus is a type of malicious software program that replicates itself and spreads from one computer to another, often without the knowledge or consent of the user. It is designed to cause damage, steal information, disrupt computer systems, or perform other harmful actions. Computer viruses can infect various types of files, including executable programs, documents, and even the master boot record of a computer.

The term "virus" is derived from its biological counterpart, as computer viruses exhibit similar behavior by infecting a host and reproducing themselves. However, unlike biological viruses, computer viruses require human intervention or specific conditions to propagate. They are typically spread through infected files, email attachments, infected websites, or removable storage devices.

Once a computer virus infects a system, it can execute various actions, depending on its design and intent. Some common effects of computer viruses include:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Replication: Viruses often aim to create multiple copies of themselves to spread to other computers or devices. They may attach their code to legitimate files or create new files with malicious code, making it challenging to detect and remove them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Destruction or Corruption: Some viruses are programmed to delete files, format hard drives, or corrupt data, resulting in loss of information and system instability. These actions can be particularly damaging to critical files or important data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unauthorized Access: Certain viruses allow unauthorized individuals to gain remote access to infected computers. This can enable hackers to control the system, monitor user activity, and steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or personal data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Botnet Creation: Viruses can transform infected computers into "zombies" or "bots," forming a network of compromised machines known as a botnet. These botnets can be remotely controlled by cybercriminals to carry out coordinated attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or spam email campaigns.

                <li>
                  Spyware and Keylogging: Some viruses are designed to track user activity, collect sensitive information, or capture keystrokes (keylogging). This information can then be used for identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to online accounts.

              <h3>History</h3><hr>
              <p> The history of computer viruses dates back to the early days of computing, when programmers discovered the potential for self-replicating and malicious code. Here is a brief overview of the key milestones in the history of computer viruses:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Creeper Virus (1971): Considered the first computer virus, the Creeper virus was created by Bob Thomas and infected mainframe computers running the TENEX operating system. It displayed the message "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" and spread to other systems through ARPANET, a precursor to the internet.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Elk Cloner (1982): Written by Richard Skrenta, Elk Cloner targeted Apple II computers through infected floppy disks. It displayed humorous poems on the screen and spread by copying itself to other disks.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Brain (1986): Brain, created by two Pakistani brothers, Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi, infected IBM PC DOS computers. It spread via infected floppy disks and was the first virus to include stealth techniques to avoid detection.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ILOVEYOU (2000): The ILOVEYOU virus, originating from the Philippines, spread through email and appeared as a love confession. It infected millions of computers globally, causing massive damages estimated at billions of dollars.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Code Red (2001): Code Red was a worm that targeted Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers. It launched distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on specific websites and defaced webpages with the message, "HELLO! Welcome to http://www.worm.com! Hacked By Chinese!"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Conficker (2008): Conficker (or Downadup) was a highly sophisticated worm that infected millions of computers running Microsoft Windows. It exploited system vulnerabilities and created a massive botnet, capable of carrying out various malicious activities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    WannaCry (2017): WannaCry was a ransomware attack that spread rapidly across the globe, infecting hundreds of thousands of computers. It exploited a vulnerability in the Windows operating system, encrypting files and demanding ransom payments in Bitcoin.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                These are just a few examples of significant computer viruses throughout history. As technology has advanced, so have the techniques and complexity of viruses, requiring ongoing efforts to develop robust security measures and educate users about safe computing practices.
              </p>
              <h3>Prevention</h3><hr>
              <p>
                Protecting against computer viruses involves implementing several security measures:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Antivirus Software: Install reputable antivirus software that can detect and remove known viruses and malware. Keep the software updated to ensure protection against the latest threats.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Software Updates: Regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and other software applications to patch security vulnerabilities that viruses can exploit.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Email Safety: Exercise caution when opening email attachments or clicking on links in suspicious emails, as viruses often spread through email. Be wary of emails from unknown senders or unexpected attachments.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Firewall and Network Security: Enable a firewall to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic, and use a secure network connection, especially when accessing sensitive information or conducting financial transactions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Regular Backups: Back up important files and data regularly to external storage devices or cloud services. This ensures that even if your system becomes infected, you can restore your data to a clean state.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                It is crucial to stay vigilant and exercise caution while using computers and the internet to mitigate the risk of computer virus infections. Being proactive about security and adopting safe computing practices can help protect against these threats and minimize potential damage.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Algebra (from Arabic ‏الجبر‎ (al-jabr) 'reunion of broken parts,[1] bonesetting'[2]) is the study of variables and the rules for manipulating these variables in formulas;[3] it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics.[4]

            Elementary algebra deals with the manipulation of variables (commonly represented by Roman letters) as if they were numbers and is therefore essential in all applications of mathematics. Abstract algebra is the name given, mostly in education, to the study of algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields. Linear algebra, which deals with linear equations and linear mappings, is used for modern presentations of geometry, and has many practical applications (in weather forecasting, for example). There are many areas of mathematics that belong to algebra, some having "algebra" in their name, such as commutative algebra, and some not, such as Galois theory.
            
            The word algebra is not only used for naming an area of mathematics and some subareas; it is also used for naming some sorts of algebraic structures, such as an algebra over a field, commonly called an algebra. Sometimes, the same phrase is used for a subarea and its main algebraic structures; for example, Boolean algebra and a Boolean algebra. A mathematician specialized in algebra is called an algebraist.</p>
